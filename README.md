## Introduction

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a next-generation front-end build tool that focuses on speed and developer experience. It offers a lightning-fast development environment, optimized builds, and modern tooling.

## Features

- ⚡ **Blazing fast hot module replacement (HMR)**
- 📦 **Optimized builds with minimal configuration**
- 🔧 **Support for modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS tools**
- 🌐 **Built-in server with live reload**
- 🔥 **Rich plugin ecosystem**

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-vite-project.git
   cd your-vite-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   or
   ```bash
